Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the rest of the application by providing a CLI interface for running the Docubot tool. It imports the Docubot module and uses it to start the documentation process on a specified file or on all files if the full process flag is set.

Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of the yargs library and how does it work?
- How does the Docubot module interact with this file and what functions does it provide?
- How can I add additional commands or options to the CLI interface?
- How can I implement the list functionality for the CLI tool?
- How can I modify the .docubotrc file to change the behavior of the tool?
- How can I handle errors or exceptions that occur during the documentation process?
- How can I test the CLI tool and ensure it is working correctly?
- How can I integrate the CLI tool with other parts of the application? 

Known Issues and TODOs:
- The list functionality is not yet implemented.
- There may be errors or exceptions that occur during the documentation process that are not handled properly.
