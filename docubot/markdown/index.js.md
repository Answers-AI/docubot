Summary:
This file is the entry point for a command line interface (CLI) tool that allows users to document code and save it into Pinecone memory. It imports several modules including docubot, pinecone, fs, path, readline, and yargs. The file defines three commands: start, save, and list. The start command takes a file path and runs the docubot tool on it. The save command saves code into Pinecone memory. The list command lists all saved files. 

Import statements:
