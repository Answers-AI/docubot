Summary:
This file is a Node.js script that defines a command-line interface (CLI) using the yargs library. It provides three commands: "start", "save", and "list", which respectively document code from a file, save code into pinecone memory, and list all saved files. 

Import statements:
The file imports the following dependencies:
- "./src/docubot.js": a module that provides the main function for documenting code from a file
- "./src/pinecone.js": a module that provides the main function for saving code into pinecone memory
- "fs": a Node.js module that provides file system-related functionality
- "path": a Node.js module that provides path-related functionality
- "readline": a Node.js module that provides an interface for reading input from a stream
- "yargs/yargs": a library for building command-line interfaces
- "yargs/helpers": a library that provides helper functions for working with yargs

Script Summary:
The script defines a CLI using yargs, with three commands: "start", "save", and "list". The "start" command takes a file path as an argument and uses the docubot module to document the code in the file. The "save" command uses the pinecone module to save code into pinecone memory. The "list" command lists all saved files.

Internal Functions:
The file does not define any internal functions.

External Functions:
The file does not define any external functions.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the rest of the application by providing a CLI that allows users to document code from a file, save code into pinecone memory, and list all saved files. Other parts of the application can use these commands to interact with the docubot and pinecone modules.

Developer Questions:
- What is the format of the input file that can be passed to the "start" command?
- How does the docubot module document code from a file?
- What is the format of the code that is saved into pinecone memory?
- How does the pinecone module store code into memory?
- How can the "list" command be implemented to list all saved files?
