Summary:
This file defines a command-line interface (CLI) using the yargs library to run the Docubot documentation tool. It defines two commands: "start" to run Docubot on a specific file and "list" to list all saved files. It also includes an option to run the full process on all files.

Import statements:
- docubot: a custom module that contains the main function for running the documentation process
- fs: a Node.js module for working with the file system
- path: a Node.js module for working with file and directory paths
- readline: a Node.js module for reading input from a user
- yargs: a library for building command-line interfaces
- hideBin: a helper function from yargs to remove the first two arguments from the process.argv array

This file interacts with the Docubot module to run the documentation process on a specific file. It also interacts with the file system to read and write files, and with the readline module to read input from the user.

Developer Questions:
- What is the structure of the command-line arguments expected by this script?
- How does the "start" command interact with the Docubot module to run the documentation process?
- How does the "list" command retrieve and display the list of saved files?
- How can I add new commands or options to the CLI defined in this script?
- How can I modify the behavior of the Docubot module to customize the documentation process?
- Are there any known issues or bugs with the CLI or the Docubot module that I should be aware of?
- What are the next steps for implementing the "list" command functionality?
- How can I test the CLI and the Docubot module to ensure they are working correctly? 

Known Issues and Todo Items:
