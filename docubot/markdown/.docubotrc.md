This file exports a function that returns an object containing configuration options for Docubot, a documentation generator tool. The configuration options include file paths, invalid paths, invalid file types, invalid file names, and file types with associated prompts and templates.

The function takes in a parameter `CODE_BASE_PATH` which is used to construct various file paths. If environment variables are set, they are used instead of default values.

The exported object is used by Docubot to determine which files to include in the generated documentation and how to prompt the user for information about those files.

The file also contains a template with a single heading for use in generating documentation.
