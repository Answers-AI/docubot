# API Documentation for Code in Larger Application

## Summary
This document provides a breakdown of the code and detailed descriptions of how the file could potentially interact with the rest of the application. It also describes in detail each API endpoint, gives an example of using the API endpoint, and provides an example of the response the API endpoint sends back to the client. Additionally, it lists out questions developers will have when working in this code base that relates to this file.

## API Endpoints

### Endpoint 1: /api/endpoint1
This endpoint does X, Y, and Z. To use this endpoint, send a POST request to the URL with the following parameters:
- Parameter 1: description
- Parameter 2: description
- Parameter 3: description

Example Request:
```javascript
POST /api/endpoint1
{
  "parameter1": "value1",
  "parameter2": "value2",
  "parameter3": "value3"
}
```

Example Response:
```javascript
{
  "response1": "value1",
  "response2": "value2",
  "response3": "value3"
}
```
