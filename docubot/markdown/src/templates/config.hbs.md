## Summary
This file is a configuration file for a service that is used in a larger application.

## Service
The service that this configuration file is for is responsible for handling user authentication and authorization.

## Configuration Summary
This configuration file sets up the service with custom settings that differ from the default settings. It includes parameters for setting up the database connection, specifying authentication and authorization methods, and configuring logging.

## Configuration Breakdown
- `db_url`: The URL for the database connection.
- `auth_method`: The method used for authentication (e.g. username/password, OAuth, etc.).
- `auth_timeout`: The amount of time before an authentication token expires.
- `auth_token_secret`: The secret key used to sign authentication tokens.
- `auth_token_algorithm`: The algorithm used to sign authentication tokens.
- `auth_token_header`: The name of the header used to send authentication tokens.
- `auth_token_cookie`: The name of the cookie used to send authentication tokens.
- `auth_token_query_param`: The name of the query parameter used to send authentication tokens.
- `auth_required`: Whether authentication is required for all requests.
- `auth_optional`: Whether authentication is optional for some requests.
- `auth_exempt`: A list of endpoints that are exempt from authentication.
- `auth_roles`: A list of roles that are allowed to access certain endpoints.
- `logging_level`: The level of logging to use (e.g. DEBUG, INFO, ERROR, etc.).
- `logging_format`: The format of the log messages.

## Interaction Summary
This configuration file could interact with other parts of the application by affecting how user authentication and authorization is handled. It could also affect how logging is done.

## Developer Questions
Developers working with this component may have the following questions when debugging or changing this file:
- How do I add a new authentication method?
- How do I change the database connection URL?
- How do I add a new role that is allowed to access certain endpoints?
