This JavaScript code is a part of a documentation generation tool that utilizes Node.js, OpenAI, Pinecone, and other libraries. The code processes files and directories, generates summaries and embeddings for the content, and stores the results in a Pinecone vector database. The main functions and features of the code include:

1. `fileProcessor`: Recursively processes files and directories, filtering out invalid files based on the provided configuration.
2. `getFileData`: Retrieves file data, including file type, tokens, model, and cost, and compiles completion prompts for the file.
3. `batchCompletionProcessor`: Processes files in batches, generating responses using OpenAI's GPT model and writing the responses to markdown files.
4. `batchEmbeddingsProcessor`: Processes files in batches, generating embeddings for the file contents and upserting the embeddings to Pinecone.
5. `writeResponsesToFile` and `writePreviewMarkdownToFile`: Write generated responses and preview prompts to markdown files.
6. `getChangedFilesWithStatus`: Retrieves the list of changed files in a Git repository, filtering out invalid files based on the provided configuration.
7. Utility functions like `getFileType`, `isInvalidFile`, and `splitFiles` to assist in processing and filtering files.

The code is designed to work with various file types and configurations, making it a versatile solution for generating documentation and storing it in a vector database.
