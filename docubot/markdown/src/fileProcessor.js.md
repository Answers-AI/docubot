Summary:
This file is responsible for processing code files, generating documentation using OpenAI's GPT-3, and creating embeddings for the generated documentation. It also handles writing the documentation to markdown files and upserting the embeddings to Pinecone, a vector database.

Import statements:
- 'fs' and 'path' are Node.js built-in modules for file system operations and handling file paths.
- 'PineconeClient' is a client for interacting with the Pinecone vector database.
- Utility functions and OpenAI functions are imported from './utils' and './openai' respectively.

Script Summary:
The script exports several functions for processing code files, generating documentation, and creating embeddings. It also provides utility functions for determining file types and handling invalid files.

Internal Functions:
1. isInvalidFile(filePath, config): Determines if a file is invalid based on the provided configuration. Returns true if the file is invalid, false otherwise.
2. getFileContents(filePath): Reads the contents of a file and returns an object containing the contents and the file path.
3. getFileType(filePath, config): Determines the file type based on the provided configuration and returns an object with the type, prompt, template, and skipCompletion properties.
4. getFilePathWithReplacedBase(file, config): Returns the file path with the base replaced by the markdown directory from the configuration.
5. generateResponses(files, gptModel): Generates GPT-3 responses for the given files and returns a promise that resolves to an array of responses.
6. generateEmbeddings(fileContentsArray): Generates embeddings for the given file contents and returns a promise that resolves to an array of embeddings.

External Functions:
1. fileProcessor(dirPath, config): Processes files in the given directory and returns an array of file data objects.
2. batchCompletionProcessor(files, config): Processes files in batches and generates GPT-3 completions for them.
3. batchEmbeddingsProcessor(allFilesToProcess, config): Processes files in batches and generates embeddings for them.
4. splitFiles(files): Splits the files into two arrays, one with files that have skipCompletion set to true, and the other with the rest of the files.
5. writeResponsesToFile(files, responses, config): Writes the GPT-3 responses to markdown files.
6. writePreviewMarkdownToFile(files, config): Writes the preview markdown to files.

Interaction Summary:
This file is used by the main application to process code files, generate documentation, and create embeddings. It interacts with the OpenAI API for generating GPT-3 completions and embeddings, and the Pinecone API for upserting embeddings to the vector database.

Developer Questions:
1. How do I add support for a new file type or language?
2. How can I customize the GPT-3 prompts for different file types?
3. How can I change the batch size for processing files?
4. How can I modify the Pinecone configuration for upserting embeddings?

Known Issues/Bugs:
1. The script assumes that the project is an npm project and uses the package.json file for namespacing the repository and its versions. This should be made more generic to support all types of projects.
2. The double extension issue in the 'getFilePathWithReplacedBase' function is currently fixed using a hack. This should be addressed properly.

Todo Items:
1. Make the script work with all types of projects, not just npm projects.
2. Fix the double extension issue in the 'getFilePathWithReplacedBase' function.
3. Improve error handling and logging throughout the script.
