This JavaScript code is a file processing module that utilizes Node.js, OpenAI, Pinecone, and other libraries to generate documentation for a given codebase. The module is designed to work with vector databases and provides various functions to process files, generate summaries, and create embeddings for the documentation.

Key features and functions of the code include:

1. `fileProcessor`: Recursively processes files in a given directory, filtering out invalid files and directories based on the provided configuration. It compiles completion prompts for each valid file and calculates the token count, model, and cost for the file.

2. `isInvalidFile`: Determines if a file is invalid based on the provided configuration, checking for invalid paths, file types, and file names.

3. `getFileType`: Identifies the file type based on the file path and configuration, returning an object containing the type, prompt, template, and skipCompletion flag.

4. `batchCompletionProcessor`: Processes files in batches, generating responses for each batch and writing the responses to the corresponding markdown files.

5. `batchEmbeddingsProcessor`: Processes files in batches, generating embeddings for each file and upserting the embeddings to Pinecone.

6. `writeResponsesToFile`: Writes the generated responses to the corresponding markdown files.

7. `writePreviewMarkdownToFile`: Writes the preview prompts to the corresponding markdown files.

8. `upsertEmbeddingsToPinecone`: Upserts the generated embeddings to Pinecone, a vector database.

9. `generateResponses`: Generates responses for the given files using the OpenAI API.

10. `generateEmbeddings`: Generates embeddings for the given file contents using the OpenAI API.

11. `splitFiles`: Splits the files into two arrays, one containing files with the skipCompletion flag set to true and the other containing the rest of the files.

12. `getChangedFilesWithStatus`: Retrieves the changed files with their status (added, modified, or deleted) using Git commands.

The module exports these functions, making them available for use in other parts of the application.
