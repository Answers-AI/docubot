Summary:
This file contains code for interacting with the OpenAI API. It exports two functions, `createEmbedding` and `createChatCompletion`, which can be used to create embeddings and chat completions respectively.

Import statements:
The file imports the `Configuration` and `OpenAIApi` classes from the `openai` module.

Script Summary:
The script creates an instance of the `Configuration` class with an API key, and then creates an instance of the `OpenAIApi` class with the configuration. It then exports two functions, `createEmbedding` and `createChatCompletion`.

Internal Functions:
- `createChatCompletion`: This function takes in a GPT model, a prompt, and an optional temperature parameter. It creates a chat completion using the OpenAI API and returns the completion. If there is no prompt, it returns null.
- `createEmbedding`: This function takes in a model and a file object, and creates an embedding using the OpenAI API. If the file object has contents, it returns an object with the file path and the response. Otherwise, it returns an object with the file path and a null response.

External Functions:
- `createEmbedding`: This function takes in a model and a file object, and creates an embedding using the OpenAI API. If the file object has contents, it returns an object with the file path and the response. Otherwise, it returns an object with the file path and a null response.
- `createChatCompletion`: This function takes in a GPT model, a prompt, and an optional temperature parameter. It creates a chat completion using the OpenAI API and returns the completion. If there is no prompt, it returns null.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the OpenAI API to create embeddings and chat completions. It could be used in a larger application to generate text or analyze text data.

Developer Questions:
- What models are available for use with `createChatCompletion`?
- What is the format of the `file` object passed to `createEmbedding`?
- What happens if the OpenAI API returns an error in `createChatCompletion` or `createEmbedding`?
- How can the temperature parameter be used to control the output of `createChatCompletion`?
- Are there any rate limits or usage restrictions for the OpenAI API that should be taken into account? 

Known Issues and TODOs:
- The `createChatCompletion` function currently has a hardcoded system prompt. This should be made dynamic.
- There may be errors that occur when interacting with the OpenAI API that are not currently handled by the code. These should be addressed.
- There may be additional functionality that could be added to these functions to make them more useful in a larger application.
