Summary:
This file contains code for interacting with the OpenAI API to create chat completions and embeddings. It exports two functions, createChatCompletion and createEmbedding.

Import statements:
The file imports the Configuration and OpenAIApi classes from the 'openai' package.

Script Summary:
The script creates an instance of the OpenAIApi class using an API key stored in the environment variables. It then exports two functions, createChatCompletion and createEmbedding.

Internal Functions:
- createChatCompletion: This function takes in a GPT model, a prompt, and an optional temperature parameter. It creates a chat completion using the OpenAI API and returns the completion.
  - Parameters:
    - gptModel: The GPT model to use for the chat completion.
    - prompt: The prompt to use for the chat completion.
    - temperature (optional): The temperature to use for the chat completion. Defaults to 0.2.
  - Returns: The chat completion response from the OpenAI API.

- createEmbedding: This function takes in a model and a file object and creates an embedding using the OpenAI API. It returns an object containing the file path and the embedding response.
  - Parameters:
    - model: The model to use for the embedding.
    - file: The file object containing the contents to embed.
  - Returns: An object containing the file path and the embedding response.

External Functions:
This file exports two functions:
- createChatCompletion: This function takes in a GPT model, a prompt, and an optional temperature parameter. It creates a chat completion using the OpenAI API and returns the completion.
- createEmbedding: This function takes in a model and a file object and creates an embedding using the OpenAI API. It returns an object containing the file path and the embedding response.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the OpenAI API to create chat completions and embeddings. It could be used by other parts of the application to generate responses to user prompts or to create embeddings for text data.

Developer Questions:
- Where is the API key for the OpenAI API stored?
- What is the format of the file object passed to createEmbedding?
- How can I test the createChatCompletion and createEmbedding functions?
- What happens if the OpenAI API returns an error response?
- Can I use a different GPT model for the chat completion?
