The given code is a Node.js script that automates the process of generating documentation for a codebase. It utilizes the OpenAI API to generate natural language descriptions of code, and Pinecone to store and retrieve vector embeddings of the generated descriptions. The script takes in various command-line arguments such as `--file`, `--full`, and `--dir` to specify the files to be processed. It also prompts the user to preview the generated prompts before proceeding with the documentation process. The script contains functions for processing files, generating cost summaries, and splitting files for completion and embedding. Notable features include the use of the `dotenv` package for loading environment variables, and the `readline` package for reading user input from the command line. The script is designed to be run from the command line using the `require.main === module` check at the end of the file.
