Summary:
This file, docubot.js, is a script that processes a codebase to generate documentation using OpenAI's GPT-3 and GPT-4 models. It counts tokens in the codebase, estimates the cost of generating documentation, and creates markdown files with the generated documentation.

Import statements:
- fs: File system module for reading and writing files.
- path: Path module for handling file paths.
- gpt3-tokenizer: Tokenizer for GPT-3 models.
- dotenv: Module for loading environment variables from a .env file.
- openai: OpenAI API client for interacting with GPT models.
- readline: Module for reading user input from the command line.

Script Summary:
The script first checks if the local config file exists and copies it from the default config if not. It then sets up the GPT-3 tokenizer and OpenAI API client. The main function processes the codebase, counting tokens, estimating the cost, and generating documentation. It also provides utility functions for copying folders, getting file names from paths, and prompting the user for input.

Internal Functions:
- copyFolderSync(src, dest): Copies a folder and its contents from src to dest.
- getFilenameFromPath(path): Returns the filename from a given file path.
- getEstimatedPricing(sortedFilePathsByTokenCount): Estimates the cost of generating documentation based on token counts.
- getPromptType(filePath): Determines the prompt type for a given file path based on the config's PROMPT_TYPE_CONDITIONS.
- getPromptAndExample(filePath): Returns the prompt and template for a given file path based on its prompt type.
- processFile(filePath): Processes a file, generating documentation using the GPT model and returning the result.
- promptUser(question): Prompts the user for input with a given question and returns their response.

External Functions:
- main(filePath): The main function that processes the codebase, counting tokens, estimating the cost, and generating documentation.

Interaction Summary:
This file can be used as a standalone script or imported as a module in other parts of the application. When used as a module, it exports the main function and utility functions for other parts of the application to use.

Developer Questions:
1. How can I add new prompt types and conditions to the config?
2. How can I adjust the GPT model parameters, such as temperature, for generating documentation?
3. How can I modify the script to support other output formats besides markdown?
4. How can I customize the token counting process for specific file types or languages?
5. How can I handle errors or edge cases when processing files and generating documentation?
