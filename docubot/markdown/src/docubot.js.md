The given code is a Node.js script that automates the documentation process for a codebase. It utilizes various modules such as dotenv, readline, and path. The script reads the configuration from a .env file and initializes the codebase. It then processes all the files in the codebase and generates a summary of the documentation cost. The user is prompted to preview the prompts before proceeding with the documentation process. If the user chooses to proceed, the script splits the files into two categories: files that require completion and files that do not. The files that require completion are sent to Pinecone, an AI-powered documentation platform, for documentation. The files that do not require completion are written directly to markdown files. The script also generates embeddings for all the files in the codebase. The script can be run from the command line with default options. The notable features of the script include the use of Pinecone for documentation and the generation of embeddings for all the files in the codebase.
