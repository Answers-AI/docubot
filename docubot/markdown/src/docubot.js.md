Summary:
This file is responsible for processing files in a given folder, generating a cost summary, and prompting the user to proceed with the operation. If the user chooses to proceed, the script splits the files into two categories, sends one category directly to writeResponsesToFile, and sends the other category to batchCompletionProcessor to get OpenAI docs. It then processes the markdown folder and gets embeddings.

Import statements:
- dotenv: loads environment variables from a .env file
- path: provides utilities for working with file and directory paths
- readline: provides an interface for reading input from a readable stream (e.g. process.stdin) and writing output to a writable stream (e.g. process.stdout)
- inititalize: a custom module that initializes the application with configuration settings
- fileProcessor, batchCompletionProcessor, batchEmbeddingsProcessor, splitFiles, writeResponsesToFile: custom modules that process files and generate OpenAI docs
- utils: a custom module that provides utility functions

Script Summary:
The script initializes the application with configuration settings, processes files in a given folder, generates a cost summary, prompts the user to proceed with the operation, and sends files to writeResponsesToFile and batchCompletionProcessor to get OpenAI docs. It then processes the markdown folder and gets embeddings.

Internal Functions:
- main: the main function that processes files, generates a cost summary, prompts the user to proceed with the operation, and sends files to writeResponsesToFile and batchCompletionProcessor to get OpenAI docs. It then processes the markdown folder and gets embeddings.

External Functions:
- main: exports the main function

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with other custom modules to process files and generate OpenAI docs. It also interacts with the readline module to prompt the user to proceed with the operation.

Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of the inititalize module and how does it work?
- How are files processed and split into skipCompletionFiles and filesForDocumentation?
- How does batchCompletionProcessor generate OpenAI docs?
- How does batchEmbeddingsProcessor process the markdown folder and get embeddings?
- What are the configuration settings used in this file and where are they defined?
- How can I modify the prompt message in the readline module?
- What happens if the user chooses not to proceed with the operation?
- Are there any known issues or bugs with this file?
- What are the todo items that need to be addressed in this file?
