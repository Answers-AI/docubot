The given code is a Node.js module that provides functions for working with OpenAI's GPT-3 language model. The module includes functions for counting the number of tokens in a given text, compiling completion prompts using Handlebars templates, and determining the appropriate GPT-3 model to use based on the number of tokens in the prompt. The module also includes a function for estimating the cost of a completion request based on the selected model and number of tokens, as well as a function for generating a summary of the cost of completion requests across multiple files. Notable features of the code include the use of the GPT3Tokenizer library for tokenizing text, the use of Handlebars for templating, and the implementation of logic for determining the appropriate GPT-3 model and estimating the cost of completion requests. The code is written in JavaScript and is designed to be used with VSCode on MacOS. The module is intended for use with vector databases that require natural language processing capabilities.
