Summary:
This file contains two functions, getTemplateFiles and readTemplateFile, that are used to read and retrieve the contents of template files. The file also includes Jest tests to ensure that these functions are working correctly.

Import statements:
The file imports the following modules:
- getTemplateFiles and readTemplateFile from './getTemplateFiles'
- fs from 'fs'
- path from 'path'
- Jest's mocking functions

Script Summary:
The file defines two functions:
- getTemplateFiles: This function takes in a file path, fs, and path as arguments. It uses fs and path to read the contents of all files in the specified directory and returns an object with the contents of each file.
- readTemplateFile: This function takes in fs and a file path as arguments. It uses fs to read the contents of the specified file and returns the contents as a string.

Internal Functions:
- None

External Functions:
- getTemplateFiles: This function takes in a file path, fs, and path as arguments. It returns an object with the contents of each file in the specified directory.
  - Parameters:
    - file path: a string representing the path to the directory containing the template files
    - fs: the fs module
    - path: the path module
  - Returns:
    - An object with the contents of each file in the specified directory
- readTemplateFile: This function takes in fs and a file path as arguments. It returns the contents of the specified file as a string.
  - Parameters:
    - fs: the fs module
    - file path: a string representing the path to the template file
  - Returns:
    - The contents of the specified file as a string

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the rest of the application by providing functions to read and retrieve the contents of template files. These functions can be used by other modules to generate dynamic content.

Developer Questions:
- What is the expected format of the template files?
- What happens if the specified directory or file path does not exist?
- How can I modify these functions to handle different file formats or encodings?
- How can I modify these functions to handle errors that may occur during file reading?
- How can I modify these functions to handle large files or directories?
- How can I modify these functions to cache the contents of the template files for faster retrieval?
- How can I modify these functions to handle asynchronous file reading? 

Known Issues/Bugs:
- None
