Summary:
This file contains two functions, `getTemplateFiles` and `readTemplateFile`, which are used to read and return the content of template files. The file also includes mock implementations for `fs` and `path` modules, and a test suite for the two functions.

Import statements:
The file imports the following modules:
- `getTemplateFiles` and `readTemplateFile` from `./getTemplateFiles`
- `fs` from the Node.js standard library
- `path` from the Node.js standard library
- `jest` for mocking modules during testing

Script Summary:
The file defines two functions:
- `getTemplateFiles`: This function takes in a file path, `fs` and `path` modules, and reads the content of all files in the directory specified by the file path. It returns an object with the file names (without extensions) as keys and the file content as values.
- `readTemplateFile`: This function takes in an `fs` module and a file path, and reads the content of the file at the specified path.

Internal Functions:
- None

External Functions:
- `getTemplateFiles`: This function takes in a file path, `fs` and `path` modules, and returns an object with the content of all files in the directory specified by the file path.
  - Parameters:
    - `filePath`: A string representing the path to the directory containing the template files.
    - `fs`: The Node.js `fs` module.
    - `path`: The Node.js `path` module.
  - Returns:
    - An object with the file names (without extensions) as keys and the file content as values.
- `readTemplateFile`: This function takes in an `fs` module and a file path, and reads the content of the file at the specified path.
  - Parameters:
    - `fs`: The Node.js `fs` module.
    - `filePath`: A string representing the path to the file to be read.
  - Returns:
    - A string representing the content of the file.

Interaction Summary:
This file does not have any direct interaction with the rest of the application. It provides utility functions that can be used by other parts of the application to read and return the content of template files.

Developer Questions:
- What is the expected format of the template files?
- How should errors be handled when reading the template files?
- How can the `getTemplateFiles` function be modified to read files recursively from subdirectories?
- How can the `readTemplateFile` function be modified to read files in binary mode instead of text mode?
- How can the mock implementations for `fs` and `path` be modified to test error handling?
