Summary:
This file contains code for processing files in a given directory, identifying their type, and determining if they are valid or not based on certain criteria. It also includes tests for the fileProcessor, getFileType, and isInvalidFile functions.

Import statements:
The file imports the fs and path modules from Node.js, as well as the fileProcessor, getFileType, and isInvalidFile functions from another file in the same directory. It also imports the getTemplateFilesModule from another file and mocks it for testing purposes.

Script Summary:
The file defines a config object with various properties related to file processing, such as the base path for the code, invalid paths, invalid file types, and file types with associated prompts and templates. It then defines tests for the fileProcessor, getFileType, and isInvalidFile functions.

Internal Functions:
- None

External Functions:
- fileProcessor: This function takes a directory path and a config object as arguments and returns an array of objects representing valid files in the directory. Each object includes the file path, type, prompt, template, and skipCompletion properties.
- getFileType: This function takes a file path and a config object as arguments and returns an object representing the file type. The object includes the type, prompt, template, and skipCompletion properties.
- isInvalidFile: This function takes a file path and a config object as arguments and returns a boolean indicating whether the file is invalid based on the config object's invalidPaths, invalidFileTypes, and invalidFileNames properties.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with other files in the same directory, as well as the Node.js fs and path modules. It also interacts with a getTemplateFiles module, which is mocked for testing purposes.

Developer Questions:
- What other file types can be added to the config object's fileTypes property?
- How can the fileProcessor function be modified to handle subdirectories?
- What happens if a file's type is not defined in the config object's fileTypes property?
- How can the isInvalidFile function be modified to handle additional criteria for invalid files?
- Are there any known issues with the mocked getTemplateFiles module?
