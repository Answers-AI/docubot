Summary:
This file contains code for testing the fileProcessor function, getFileType function, and isInvalidFile function. It also sets up mock implementations for the getTemplateFiles function and the fs module.

Import statements:
The file imports the fs and path modules, as well as the fileProcessor, getFileType, and isInvalidFile functions from a local file called fileProcessor.js. It also imports the getTemplateFilesModule from a local file called getTemplateFiles.js. Finally, it uses the jest.mock function to mock the getTemplateFiles function and the fs module.

Script Summary:
The file sets up mock implementations for the getTemplateFiles function and the fs module. It then defines a config object with various properties related to file types and paths. It contains three describe blocks for testing the fileProcessor, getFileType, and isInvalidFile functions. Each test block contains one or more test cases that assert the expected behavior of the function being tested.

Internal Functions:
None.

External Functions:
None.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the fileProcessor, getFileType, and isInvalidFile functions from the fileProcessor.js file. It also interacts with the getTemplateFiles function from the getTemplateFiles.js file. Additionally, it sets up mock implementations for the fs module, which could affect any code that uses the fs module.

Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of the config object and how is it used?
- How does the mock implementation for the fs module affect the behavior of the fileProcessor function?
- What other functions or modules does this file interact with?
- Are there any other mock implementations that need to be set up for testing other parts of the application?
- Are there any known issues or bugs with the code in this file?
- Are there any todo items related to this file that need to be addressed?
