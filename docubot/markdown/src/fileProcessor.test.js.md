The given code is a Node.js module that processes files in a codebase directory and identifies their file type based on their extension. It also checks if the file is invalid based on certain criteria such as invalid paths, file types, and file names. The module uses Jest for testing and mocks certain dependencies such as the file system module and a module for getting template files. 

The main functionality of the module is provided by the `fileProcessor` function, which takes a directory path and a configuration object as input and returns an array of objects representing the processed files. Each object contains information about the file such as its path, file type, prompt, template, and skipCompletion flag. 

The `getFileType` function is used to determine the file type of a given file path based on the configuration object. The `isInvalidFile` function is used to check if a file is invalid based on the configuration object's invalidPaths, invalidFileTypes, and invalidFileNames properties. 

Notable features of the code include the use of Jest for testing and the mocking of certain dependencies to isolate the code being tested. The code also uses promises for asynchronous operations and the path module for working with file paths.
