Summary:
This file exports two functions, `getTemplateFiles` and `readTemplateFile`, which are used to read and retrieve the contents of template files.

Import statements:
The file imports the `fs` and `path` modules from Node.js.

Script Summary:
The file defines two functions, `getTemplateFiles` and `readTemplateFile`. `readTemplateFile` reads the contents of a file and returns it as a string. `getTemplateFiles` reads all the files in a directory and returns an object containing the contents of each file, with the file name (without extension) as the key.

Internal Functions:
- `readTemplateFile`: This function takes two parameters, `fs` and `filePath`. It uses the `fs` module to read the contents of the file at `filePath` and returns the contents as a string.

- `getTemplateFiles`: This function takes three parameters, `templateFilePath`, `fsModule`, and `pathModule`. It uses the `fsModule` module to read the list of files in the `templateFilePath` directory. It then loops through each file, reads its contents using the `readTemplateFile` function, and adds the contents to an object with the file name (without extension) as the key. The function returns this object.

External Functions:
- `getTemplateFiles`: This function takes three parameters, `templateFilePath`, `fsModule`, and `pathModule`. It returns an object containing the contents of each file in the `templateFilePath` directory.

- `readTemplateFile`: This function takes two parameters, `fs` and `filePath`. It returns the contents of the file at `filePath` as a string.

Interaction Summary:
This file is used to read and retrieve the contents of template files. It could be used in conjunction with other modules to generate dynamic content based on these templates.

Developer Questions:
- What is the expected format of the template files?
- What happens if a file in the `templateFilePath` directory is not a valid template file?
- Can this module be used to write to template files as well?
- How can this module be integrated with other modules to generate dynamic content? 

Known Issues and Todo Items:
There are no known issues or bugs with this component. However, a possible todo item could be to add error handling for cases where the `templateFilePath` directory does not exist or cannot be read.
