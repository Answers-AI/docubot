Summary:
This file exports two functions, `getTemplateFiles` and `readTemplateFile`, which are used to read and retrieve the contents of template files.

Import statements:
The file imports the `fs` and `path` modules from Node.js.

Script Summary:
The script defines two functions, `getTemplateFiles` and `readTemplateFile`, which are used to read and retrieve the contents of template files. `getTemplateFiles` reads all the files in a given directory and returns an object containing the contents of each file, keyed by the file name without the extension. `readTemplateFile` reads the contents of a single file and returns it as a string.

Internal Functions:
- `readTemplateFile`: This function takes in two parameters, `fs` and `filePath`. It uses the `fs` module to read the contents of the file at `filePath` and returns it as a string.

- `getTemplateFiles`: This function takes in three parameters, `templateFilePath`, `fsModule`, and `pathModule`. It uses the `fsModule` module to read all the files in the `templateFilePath` directory, and then loops through each file, reading its contents using the `readTemplateFile` function. It then creates an object containing the contents of each file, keyed by the file name without the extension, and returns it.

External Functions:
- `getTemplateFiles`: This function takes in three parameters, `templateFilePath`, `fsModule`, and `pathModule`. It returns an object containing the contents of each file in the `templateFilePath` directory, keyed by the file name without the extension.

- `readTemplateFile`: This function takes in two parameters, `fs` and `filePath`. It returns the contents of the file at `filePath` as a string.

Interaction Summary:
This file is used to read and retrieve the contents of template files. It could be used in a larger application to dynamically generate HTML or other types of files based on templates.

Developer Questions:
- What is the expected format of the template files?
- What happens if a file in the `templateFilePath` directory is not a valid template file?
- Can this code handle large template files without running out of memory?
- How can I test this code to ensure it is working correctly?
- Are there any security concerns with using this code to read files from the file system?
- Can this code be used to read files from a remote server or only from the local file system?
- How can I handle errors that may occur when reading the template files?
- Are there any performance issues with using this code to read a large number of template files?
- Is there any way to cache the contents of the template files to improve performance?
- How can I ensure that the file paths passed to these functions are valid and safe to use? 

Known Issues/TODO:
- None.
