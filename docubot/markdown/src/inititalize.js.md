Script Summary:
The file exports four functions: init, initConfigFile, initPromptsFolder, and initTemplatesFolder. The init function calls the other three functions to initialize the prompts and templates folders and return the configuration file.

Internal Functions:
- initConfigFile: This function takes a folder path as a parameter and copies a default configuration file to the folder if one does not exist. It then returns the configuration file.
- copyFolderSync: This is a helper function that takes a source and destination path as parameters and copies a folder recursively.
- initPromptsFolder: This function takes a configuration object and folder path as parameters and copies the prompts folder to the folder path if it does not exist.
- initTemplatesFolder: This function takes a configuration object and folder path as parameters and copies the templates folder to the folder path if it does not exist.

External Functions:
- init: This function takes a folder path as a parameter and returns a Promise that resolves with the configuration object after initializing the prompts and templates folders.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the larger application by providing functions that initialize and configure the prompts and templates folders for a documentation bot. It also copies a default configuration file if one does not exist.

Developer Questions:
- What is the format of the configuration file?
- What happens if the prompts or templates folders already exist?
- What happens if the default configuration file cannot be copied?
- How can I customize the prompts and templates folders? 
- How can I modify the configuration file?
