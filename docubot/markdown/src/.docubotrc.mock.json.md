Summary:
This is a configuration file for a larger application. It contains various parameters that define the behavior of the application, such as file paths, file types, and prompts. 

Configuration Summary:
The configuration file defines various parameters that are used to determine which files should be processed by the application. It also defines prompts and templates that are used to generate documentation for each file.

Configuration Breakdown:
- codeBasePath: The base path for the application's code.
- pineconeIndexName: The name of the Pinecone index used for search.
