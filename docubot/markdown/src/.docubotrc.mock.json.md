Summary:
This is a configuration file for a larger application that specifies various paths, file types, and prompts for generating documentation. It also includes a list of invalid paths, file types, and file names that should be excluded from the documentation generation process.

Service:
The service that this configuration file is for is not specified in the file itself.

Configuration Summary:
This configuration file specifies various parameters for generating documentation, including the base path for the code, the name of the Pinecone index, the namespace for Pinecone, and the directories for the Docubot and Markdown files. It also includes a list of invalid paths, file types, and file names that should be excluded from the documentation generation process. Additionally, it specifies different file types and prompts for generating documentation for different types of files, such as React components, API routes, configuration files, scripts, and content models.

Configuration Breakdown:
- codeBasePath: specifies the base path for the code
- pineconeIndexName: specifies the name of the Pinecone index
- pineconeNamespace: specifies the namespace for Pinecone
- docubotDirectoryName: specifies the directory name for Docubot
- docubotDirectory: specifies the directory for Docubot
- markdownDirectory: specifies the directory for Markdown files
- promptsFilePath: specifies the file path for prompts
- templateFilePath: specifies the file path for templates
- packageJsonPath: specifies the file path for package.json
- invalidPaths: specifies a list of invalid paths that should be excluded from the documentation generation process
- invalidFileTypes: specifies a list of invalid file types that should be excluded from the documentation generation process
- invalidFileNames: specifies a list of invalid file names that should be excluded from the documentation generation process
- fileTypes: specifies different file types and prompts for generating documentation for different types of files, such as React components, API routes, configuration files, scripts, and content models

Interaction Summary:
This configuration file interacts with the rest of the application by specifying various parameters for generating documentation. It ensures that only valid files are included in the documentation generation process and provides prompts and templates for generating documentation for different types of files.

Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of this configuration file?
- How do I modify the list of invalid paths, file types, and file names?
- How do I add a new file type and prompt for generating documentation?
- How do I modify the base path for the code or the directories for Docubot and Markdown files?
- How do I modify the prompts and templates for generating documentation for different types of files?
