This code is a test suite for a set of utility functions that are used to interact with OpenAI's GPT-3 language model. The functions include `countTokens`, which counts the number of tokens in a given string using the GPT-3 tokenizer, `compileCompletionPrompts`, which compiles a set of prompts for the GPT-3 model based on a given template and set of prompts, `getCompletionModelBasedOnTokenSize`, which returns the appropriate GPT-3 model based on the number of tokens in a given string, `getEstimatedPricing`, which returns the estimated cost of using a given GPT-3 model for a given number of tokens, and `generateCostSummary`, which generates a summary of the estimated cost of using various GPT-3 models for a set of files.

The code utilizes Nodejs, OpenAI, Pinecone, VSCode, and MacOS. Notable features include the use of the GPT-3 tokenizer and the ability to estimate the cost of using different GPT-3 models for a given set of files.
