Summary:
This file is responsible for indexing markdown files and their associated code snippets into Pinecone, a vector database. It uses the OpenAI API to generate embeddings for each markdown file and then upserts them into Pinecone. 

Import statements:
- dotenv: loads environment variables from a .env file
- fs: provides an API for interacting with the file system
- path: provides utilities for working with file and directory paths
- Configuration, OpenAIApi: from the openai package, used for interacting with the OpenAI API
- PineconeClient: from the @pinecone-database/pinecone package, used for interacting with Pinecone
- GPT3Tokenizer: from the gpt3-tokenizer package, used for tokenizing markdown files
- countTokensRecursively: a custom function for counting the number of tokens in a markdown file

Script Summary:
- Copies the config file to the local project if it does not exist
- Creates the 'docubot' folder the first time the script is run
- Initializes the Pinecone client and logs relevant information
- Counts the total number of tokens in all markdown files in the specified directory
- Checks if the Pinecone index already exists and creates it if it does not
- Processes all markdown files in the specified directory by generating embeddings and upserting them into Pinecone
- Logs relevant information about the embeddings and their upsertion

Internal Functions:
- getAllFiles: recursively gets all markdown files in a directory and returns them in an array
  - Parameters: folderPath (string), fileList (array)
  - Returns: fileList (array)
- processEmbeddings: generates embeddings for each markdown file and returns them in an array
  - Parameters: files (array)
  - Returns: embeddingBatches (array)
- upsertEmbeddingsToPinecone: upserts embeddings into Pinecone
  - Parameters: embeddings (array), index (object)
  - Returns: none
- processMarkdownFiles: processes all markdown files in a directory by generating embeddings and upserting them into Pinecone
  - Parameters: folderPath (string), index (object)
  - Returns: none

External Functions:
- main: the main function that is called when the script is run
  - Parameters: none
  - Returns: none

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the OpenAI API and Pinecone. It uses the OpenAI API to generate embeddings for each markdown file and upserts them into Pinecone. It also interacts with the file system to read and write files.

Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of Pinecone and how is it used in this application?
- What is the format of the embeddings generated by the OpenAI API?
- How are code snippets associated with their corresponding markdown files?
- How are tokens counted in the countTokensRecursively function?
- What happens if a markdown file contains no tokens?
